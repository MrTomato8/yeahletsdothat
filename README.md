Yeah Let's Do That
==================

"Yeah Let's Do That" is a Bitcoin-based crowd-funding tool (early Alpha stage)

This is early alpha stage â€“ or as Germans say: "Alles noch das totale Gefrickel!".

DO NOT USE THIS! 

If you want to try it, use the Bitcoin testnet only.

bitcoin.conf
------------

Your bitcoind/bitcoin-qt configuration file should look like this.

    testnet=1
    server=1
    rpcuser=bitcoinrpc
    rpcpassword=*yourpassword*
